## Unknown Commands

The bot handles unrecognized commands gracefully by informing the user that the command is unknown and suggesting to use `/help` to see the list of valid commands.


---

### Notes

- **UserId** must be a numeric Telegram ID (not `@username`).
- Only users with `IsAdmin = true` can run admin-level commands.
- Use `/help` inside the bot to view this command list interactively.

# üß± General Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture to maintain clean separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

---

### üì° API Layer
- Acts as the **entry point** for all external requests.
- Handles HTTP endpoints or Telegram webhook triggers.
- Responsible for routing and request delegation to the business layer.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è BLL (Business Logic Layer)
- Contains all **core application logic**.
- Main components:
  - `FlowService` ‚Äì routes Telegram commands to the appropriate handlers.
  - **Supporting Services**:
    - `AIChatService` ‚Äì handles AI features (e.g. Gemini).
    - `TelegramService` ‚Äì manages Telegram Bot interactions.
    - `TelegramFileLoaderService` ‚Äì downloads and processes user-uploaded files from Telegram.
    - `MindeeService` ‚Äì integrates with the Mindee document API.
    - `DuplicateRequestDetectorService` ‚Äì prevents duplicate or rapid requests.
    - `PolicyGenerationService` ‚Äì generates PDF versions of policies and documents.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è DAL (Data Access Layer)
- Contains:
  - **Entity Framework Core models** ‚Äì representing entities such as `User`, `Policy`, `Document`, etc.
  - `DbContext` ‚Äì manages database schema and entity tracking.
  - **Repositories** ‚Äì encapsulate query and persistence logic for accessing the database.

# Why Hierarchical CQRS + MediatR is a Poor Fit for a Telegram Bot for Car Insurance Sales

## CQRS + MediatR is Overkill for This Telegram Bot

- **CQRS** is an architectural pattern that separates read and write models.
- It often requires:
  - A second read database
  - Microservices for independent scaling
- This adds significant complexity and usually involves extra libraries like **MediatR**.

---

## Why This Is Not a Good Fit for Our Bot

- The Telegram bot handles simple command processing and user interactions.
- CQRS overhead makes:
  - Development more complicated
  - Maintenance harder
  - Debugging slower
- No real benefit given the bot‚Äôs straightforward requirements.

### Summary

**CQRS + MediatR is overkill and introduces unnecessary complexity, infrastructure, and operational costs for a simple Telegram bot for car insurance sales.**
